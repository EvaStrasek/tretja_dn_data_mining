# Homework 3 - Web scraping

This project is a Python-based web application developed with Streamlit. The application scrapes e-commerce data (Products, Testimonials, and Reviews) from a sandbox website, processes and cleans the data, and performs sentiment analysis on customer reviews using a Hugging Face Transformer model.

Users can interactively explore the data through a sidebar navigation, filter reviews by month in 2023, and view the distribution of positive vs. negative sentiment, including model confidence scores. The application is deployed as a live web service and demonstrates a complete data pipeline: web scraping, data processing, NLP-based sentiment analysis, visualization, and cloud deployment
